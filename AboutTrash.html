  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p> Trash is about people. A world without trash is a world without people. Because people have hopes, dreams, desires, imagninations and forethought. These are the elements in the human race that lead to the creation of art, music, philosophical thought, scientific discovery, systems of societal organization and ultimately the production of trash. A world without us is a world without trash. In large measure because we like to share our ideas and create a permanence about them. So there is paper. And there are similar philosophical reasons for all forms of trash but most of them, save for something like war rubble, originate in someone, somewhere pursuing the germ of an idea to advance the human cause, whatever that might mean.</p>

<div class="info_category">
  <h1>What and Where</h1>
  <p> Trash is a by-product of human thought, and actions, based on those thoughts and anywhere humans live, trash will be found a short distance away. The idea of trash is defined by several categories including litter, landfill and recyclables. Litter is a form of trash defies the control of societal and government organizations. Litter is most noticeable in American cities in the ring surrounding the urban core which also often is a ring economic distress. These areas are marked by the presence of litter, the absence of disposal options and a sense of apathy. </p>

  <h1 id="solutions-heading">Solutions</h1>
  <p> As with most problems, trash issues can be addressed with a combination of technology, money and societal will power. Our organization is peopled by individuals impassioned by the desire to declutter and unlitter the places where they live, work, worship and relax. We work with local governments, civic leaders, private businesses, community organizations and individuals seeking to solve the uncontrolled litter problems in their neighborhood. As a organization we are young and new and super serious. </p>

 <p> We are raising funds and exploring litter solutions including the following ideas
   <ol class="idea-list">
     <li> Putting advanced solar trash compacters in high use areas</li>
     <li> Sponsoring litter-eating robot competitions </li>
     <li> Organizing and populating communitiy unlitter days complete with entertainment and food served on compostable dinnerware. </li> 
   </ol>
