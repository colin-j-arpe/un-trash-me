	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>The Un-Trash-Me Organization was founded by Colin Arpe, Margarat Wismer and Eric Falchier. Our organization strives to clean the earth by throwing away the world's trash. On July 4, 1776, George Washington rode in to the city of Philadelphia for a dinner with Ben Franklin. Franklin, a heavy drinker at the time, spilled his wine on Washington's shirt. Colin, Margarat and Eric, native Philadelphians, noticed that George Washington, a visitor to the city at the time, had no place to throw away his stained shirt. It was here, at 422 Chestnut St., Colin, Margarat and Eric placed their first trash can. Now, The Un-Trash-Me Organization has 2,000 volunteers in 70 cities across the globe.</p>

	<h1>Our Work</h1>
	<p>The Great Philadelphia Trash Problem: In 1887, Philadelphia had so much trash problem that Mayor Jim Kenney declared martial law. The Un-Trash-Me Organization stepped in to clean the city with 800 volunteers over the course of two years. Philadelphia is still the diriest city despite the clean up.</p>
	<p>The China Tea Trash Crisis: After the British withdrawal from China in 1901, the British decided to take all existing trash cans with them. The Un-Trash-Me Organization sent 2,000 volunteers to China to supply them with 1,000,000 trash can and garbage cans. China is now "trash-free".</p>
